Little did you know that among the many aristocrats invited, you would find a burned enemy spy. Your goal quickly became to capture him, which you succeeded in doing after putting something in his drink. Many hours passed in your agency&#39;s interrogation room, and you eventually learned important information about the enemy agency&#39;s secret communications. Can you use what you learned to decrypt the rest of the messages?
